Keys pressed:  \<up>\<up>\<up>\<up>\<enter> to open Vim ListExamples.java, then in command mode: /<up> x 5, wr2:wq<enter> 

To get to the line in question, we shifted up 5 lines from the starting point. Then we needed to shift right by one word, and replaced the character 1 with 2 using "r2", then saved and exited using ":wq".

Keys pressed \<up>\<up>\<up>\<up>\<up>\<enter> to retrieve the "git add ." command, then I typed out "git commit -m 'update'" to stage the changes, and then typed out "git push" to push to the changes to the github repo.

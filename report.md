Keys pressed: g i t c l o n e /<Ctrl>+v /<Enter>

The repository link was in my clipboard, so I typed the words git clone and then copied the link in order to download the repository to the remote terminal.

Keys pressed:  /<up arrow> x 5, wr2:wq<enter> 

To get to the line in question, we shifted up 5 lines from the starting point. Then we needed to shift right by one word, and replaced the character 1 with 2 using "r2", then saved and exited using ":wq".
